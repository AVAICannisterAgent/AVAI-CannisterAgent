## AVAI Frontend
- Ensure NodeJS is installed and is properly working in your system. Go to `https://nodejs.org/en/download` for installing NodeJS if not installed and follow instructions there.
- To run the frontend application in  development mode, run `npm install` from the root directory to install required node modules.
- Then, from the /frontend directory itself, run `npm run dev`.
- The project should be up and running at `https://localhost:3000` by default. URL might vary if the port is taken. Nextjs should provide you the actual URL in the terminal it is running from.
